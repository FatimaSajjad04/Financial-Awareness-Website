        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>The main objective of this website is to identify the problems faced due to lack of financial literacy in low-income areas, spread awareness regarding it and to provide a solution using the knowledge of information and communication technology.</p>

        <h2>Statistics</h2>
        <p>Roughly 33 percent of adults worldwide are financially literate, whereas the remaining population faces hardships due to their insufficient knowledge of financial literacy.</p>

        <h2>Causes of Lack of Financial Literacy</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Lack of practical financial education</li>
            <li>Lack of resources to provide basic financial knowledge</li>
            <li>Lack of awareness regarding this problem</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Problems Faced Due to Lack of Financial Literacy</h2>
        <h3>Lack of Budgeting Skills</h3>
        <p>A person without prior knowledge of financial literacy wouldnâ€™t know how to create and maintain a budget, leading to difficulties in tracking income and expenses.</p>

        <h3>Debt Management</h3>
        <p>Without financial knowledge, people may lack strategies for managing and repaying debts, potentially resulting in foreclosure of property and issues with student loan repayment.</p>

        <h3>Lack of Awareness of Financial Products</h3>
        <p>Insufficient financial knowledge keeps people unaware of helpful financial products, such as savings accounts, mortgages, and insurances.</p>

        <h3>Understanding of Credit/Debit Cards</h3>
        <p>A lack of understanding about credit and debit cards, and the difference between the two, can lead to debt accumulation and difficulty in tracking transactions.</p>

        <h3>Lack of Knowledge About Inflation and Taxes</h3>
        <p>Absence of financial literacy affects long-term financial planning. Many people fail to account for inflation and misunderstand tax implications, causing financial stress.</p>

        <h3>Investment Scams</h3>
        <p>Financially illiterate individuals are more prone to investment scams such as Ponzi schemes and cryptocurrency scams. This erodes trust in financial institutions and causes significant financial loss.</p>

        <h3>High-Interest Debts</h3>
        <p>High-interest debts, such as credit card debt and payday loans, reduce financial flexibility, increase stress, and impact long-term goals.</p>

        <h3>Lack of Financial Education in Workplaces</h3>
        <p>Limited financial literacy training and lack of employee assistance programs contribute to reduced job satisfaction and inadequate retirement savings.</p>

        <h2>Repercussions if the Problem Remains Unsolved</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Poor credit</li>
            <li>Bankruptcy</li>
            <li>Foreclosure of property</li>
